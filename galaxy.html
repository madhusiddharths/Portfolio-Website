      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        A star-gazing application using Streamlit, Polars, and Plotly that displays visible stars based on
        the user's geographic location, viewing direction, and angle from the horizon. The system calculates real-time
        star positions using astronomical and geospatial data to provide an accurate and interactive sky map. A creative
        extension of the project simulates viewing Earth‚Äôs historical events from distant stars by accounting for
        light-travel time, enabling users to conceptually ‚Äúlook back in time.‚Äù The platform combines precise celestial
        computation (earth's tilt, location of the event, star & earth's revolution, etc) with an intuitive interface,
        allowing users to explore both the present sky and past Earth timelines.

      <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Dataset Overview</p>
      <p>
        The project uses the Gaia DR-3 dataset, which contains records of over 1.8 billion stars and more than 150
        features. The dataset is distributed across 3,386 files using Healpix level 12 partitioning, occupying over
        750 GB. These features include positional data, brightness measurements, astrophysical properties, filtering
        metrics, and derived attributes.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Initial Preprocessing</p>
      <p>
        To manage the data effectively, an initial preprocessing step was performed. This involved dropping unnecessary
        columns and repartitioning the data using Healpix level 2, resulting in 192 Parquet files totaling approximately
        500 GB. This made the dataset more manageable and optimized for further processing.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Phase 1: Visible Stars Pipeline</p>
      <p>
        The first pipeline focused on identifying stars visible to the naked eye from Earth. Stars were filtered based
        on brightness and distance, and additional irrelevant columns were removed. The cleaned data was then merged
        into a single Parquet file for efficient access and real-time usage in the star-gazing application.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Phase 2: Scientific Star Pipeline</p>
      <p>
        The second pipeline aimed for scientific precision. It applied stricter filtering criteria as recommended by the
        Gaia DR-3 documentation to extract a subset of approximately 650 million scientifically reliable stars.
        This refined dataset was further partitioned into over 200 Parquet files based on each star‚Äôs light-year
        distance from Earth. It was used in the Galaxy Explorer phase of the project to simulate how Earth‚Äôs history
        would appear from different points in the galaxy.

      <h2>Night Sky Explorer</h2>
      <p>
        The Night Sky Explorer offers users an accurate, real-time view of the night sky based on their geographic
        location (latitude and longitude), viewing direction (with north at 0¬∞), and angle above the horizon. It
        visualizes precise star positions using filtered data limited to those visible to the naked eye. To account
        for varying light pollution, the app includes a brightness filter based on stellar magnitude‚Äîranging from 6.5
        (dark rural skies) to 2 (bright urban skies). While it doesn‚Äôt simulate atmospheric conditions like clouds, it
        provides a clear and interactive experience of how the night sky appears from any point on Earth under different
        visibility conditions.

      <h2>Galaxy Explorer</h2>
      <p>
        The Galaxy Explorer is a data-driven celestial analysis tool that identifies stars from which past Earth
        events could theoretically be observed in real time, based on the concept of light-travel delay. Assuming
        access to an extremely powerful telescope, the tool calculates which stars would currently be receiving
        light from a specific event on Earth. It factors in Earth‚Äôs rotation, axial tilt, revolution, the star‚Äôs
        position and motion, the event‚Äôs geographic location and duration, and the time taken for light to travel.
        The output is a ranked table of the top 10 stars with the highest visibility likelihood‚Äîfiltering out stars
        that would miss the event due to misalignment or insufficient event duration.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The project faced several challenges, with three key hurdles standing out:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Size:</strong> The dataset started at 750 GB, requiring the development of fast and efficient
          data pipelines to filter relevant information while storing intermediate outputs for quick access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex Data Structure:</strong> With over 150 columns, each containing unique information‚Äîranging
          from star composition and positional data to correlations and metrics‚Äîit was crucial to understand the
          significance of each feature. We had to carefully decide how to filter, process, and leverage this data to
          meet the project's objectives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scientific Accuracy:</strong> Ensuring the project‚Äôs scientific validity was another major challenge.
          Numerous factors influenced the results, so we needed to brainstorm and incorporate these variables into our
          calculations to maintain precision and reliability.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>


    <section style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This project deepened my understanding of the complexities involved in large-scale data preprocessing,
        especially under time and resource constraints. It also gave me valuable insight into the scientific
        principles behind observing and tracking stars, including the calculations required to determine their future
        positions. Additionally, working with Polars allowed me to experience firsthand its performance advantages
        over Pandas when handling massive datasets.
